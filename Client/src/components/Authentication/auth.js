     * ** TODO IMPORTANT **
     * 
     * Need to add token fetch from API as well as 
     * Creating account methods
     * 
     * Sign In
     *      Send username and password to API and retrieve token
     *      Store token in state --> Need to add this to state JSON
     * 
     * Sign Out
     *      Send delete token and return to sign in page
     *      Since this is the only option that requires returning
     *      to login page will likely be able to store this
     *      in true-false value in state
     * 
     * Sign Up
     *      This will at the least require the same amount as Sign In
     *      However this can change depending on how sign up is implemented later
     *      Goal might be to have Sign up only called on completion, and handle
     *      the rest in its own component
